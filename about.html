      <h1>About blog</h1>

      <p>Linux is an exceptionally powerful operating system known for its customization capabilities. Moreover, even complex ideas can often be brought to life with simple solutions.</p>

      <p>Numerous distributions come equipped with a plethora of tools for image and video manipulation, MP3 tag editing, window management, program customization, desktop aesthetics, backup scripting, and more.</p>
      
      <p>However, the challenge frequently lies in the requirement for users to be proficient in multiple applications and their integration. Each endeavor becomes a gamble, with uncertainty whether the desired outcome is achievable. This often leads to hours spent navigating through various blogs and Stack Overflow posts in search of answers.</p>
      
      <p>Having exclusively used Windows for over a decade, I found myself yearning to accomplish tasks beyond its limitations. Upon realizing that Linux offers solutions for most challenges, I became deeply driven to learn about the system.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, Microsoft's operating systems have significantly improved in stability (many users have vivid memories of the challenges with Windows 95 and 98). Rather than enhancing functionality, they initially introduced less popular ideas like the Metro interface and reorganized various features, only making them harder to locate, just so it looks like something's changed in the latest version.</p>

      <p>However, the company has recently made significant strides in cloud infrastructure, system software, gaming, and (finally!) user interfaces and overall daily system experience.</p>

      <p>Finally, Microsoft something to Notepad, introduced practical system-wide shortcuts that greatly improve navigation, and developed fantastic tools like PowerToys. These improvements have made Windows not only competitive with Linux in terms of customizability but often superior in comfort, stability and ease of use.</p>

      <p>This blog primarily focuses on exploring customization options and the synergy among applications to enhance the daily system usage experience for both operating systems.</p>
      
      <p>As a fervent enthusiast of Python, which I prefer over Bash for advanced system scripts, many solutions presented here will be primarily written in Python.</p>
      
      <p>Despite Python scripts often being more verbose (which they almost always are), they possess the advantage of cross-system compatibility. Modifying a script to function on another major operating system typically requires only minimal code adjustments.</p>

      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>My name is Chris Blachewicz, and I am a programmer based in the beautiful city of Krakow, Poland.</p>
      
      <p>For the majority of my professional career, I worked as a web developer and content creator. My journey into programming began years ago with an initial foray into C++, though I did not progress far. However, my trajectory changed when I became acquainted with Python.</p>
      
      <p>Python is an absolutely remarkable language, boasting an immense array of high-quality libraries across all domains. Virtually every imaginative idea I conceive has a corresponding perfect library. With such extensive functionality bundled into the language, the life of a programmer becomes significantly easier and more comfortable!</p>

      <p>And more so because the language itself is very simple, concise and often perfectly readable and understandable by people who have minimum or no coding knowledge at all!</p>
      
      <p>Presently, I am in the process of transitioning to programming, hoping to soon being able to devote 100% of my work hours to it.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to Python, I am proficient in Bash, Linux servers, HTML, CSS, Django, Jekyll, Pandas, SQL databases, and several other tools to varying degrees.</p>
